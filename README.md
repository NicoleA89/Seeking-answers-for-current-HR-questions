# IT professionals from the perspective of HR
A data based approach using the Stack Overflow developer survey data (2017)

## Introduction
Given the (current and future) shortage of skilled workers and demographic change, it is increasingly difficult for companies to find qualified (IT)-professionals. In this article I examined on which job portals worldwide and in Germany qualified developers can be found. The question as to which portals female IT professionals can primarily be found is also being investigated.

Perhaps you have noticed how companies already have to fight for professionals - especially in the field of IT. With that in mind, let´s find out with the data from the Stack Overflow developer survey (2017) on which job portals the participants are present. The survey data was taken by more than 50,000 participants and aims to understand different aspects of job related questions.

## Q1: On which job portals can (German) companies find qualified developers?

Half of the participants answered this question, so the results are based on just under 25,000 participants, who could answer this question with multiple answer options. To get an overview where to find the top candidates, only the top 8 job portals were considered in this article.

## Findings
Insgesamt zeigt diese Betrachtung, dass weltweit für Unternehmen, die nach IT Fachkräften suchen, LinkedIn als erste Anlaufstelle verwendet werden sollte, da dort rund 2/3 der Befragten mit einem Account vertreten sind. Bei dem Vergleich mit Deutschland zeigt sich, dass LinkedIn zwar weiterhin vertreten ist und hier auch rund 1/3 der Befragten einen Account haben, das beliebteste Jobportal in Deutschland ist für IT professionals jedoch Xing. Hier haben rund 2/3 der Befragten professionals aus Deutschland einen Account.

Overall this analysis shows that, for companies looking for IT professionals, LinkedIn is the most promising adress worldwide. Compared with Germany LinkedIn is still represented, but the most popular job portal in Germany for IT professionals is Xing.
