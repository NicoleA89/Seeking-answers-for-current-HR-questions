A data based approach using the Stack Overflow developer survey data (2017)

## Introduction
Given the (current and future) shortage of skilled workers and demographic change, it is increasingly difficult for companies to find qualified (IT)-professionals. In this article I examined on which job portals worldwide and in Germany qualified developers can be found. The question as to which portals female IT professionals can primarily be found is also being investigated.

Perhaps you have noticed how companies already have to fight for professionals - especially in the field of IT. With that in mind, letÂ´s find out with the data from the Stack Overflow developer survey (2017) on which job portals the participants are present. The survey data was taken by more than 50,000 participants and aims to understand different aspects of job related questions.

## Q1: On which job portals can (German) companies find qualified developers?

Half of the participants answered this question, so the results are based on just under 25,000 participants, who could answer this question with multiple answer options. To get an overview where to find the top candidates, only the top 8 job portals were considered in this article.

On this chart you can see the top 8 job portals that the survey participants  from all countries use. Linkedin is by far the most popular job portal with a share of 60 %. It is followed by Xing (8,4 %), Monster (7,1 %) and Indeed (6,8 %).
