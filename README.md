# Seeking answers for current HR questions
*A data based approach based on the results of Stack Overflow developer survey data (2017). The survey data was taken by more than 50,000 participants and aims to understand different aspects of job related questions (the full dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017).*

## Introduction
Given the current shortage of skilled workers and demographic change, it is increasingly difficult for companies to find qualified talents - especially in the IT segment. Where can companies find qualified IT profossionals? What should a company offer those professionals in terms of salary or workplace flexibility? This investigation will help to get an overview of where to **find those talents**, how much **salary** they are used to getting and in which extend they usually **work remote**. So let´s dig in and take a close look!

## The war for talents...
### On which job portals can (German) companies find qualified IT professionals?
The war for talents is getting tougher - especially in the IT segment. Let´s find out with the data from the Stack Overflow developer survey (2017) which job portals IT professionals prefer to use. The professionals were asked to list all job portals where they have a profile. In the table below you can see the TOP 5 answers to this question.

Here you can see that Xing is by the most popular job portal with a share of 60 %. It is followed by LinkedIn (~ 28 %), Monster (~ 3 %) and StepStone (~ 3 %).

### Findings
Overall this analysis shows that LinkedIn is the most promising adress worldwide if you are looking for IT professionals. In Germany LinkedIn is still well represented, but the most popular job portal for IT professionals in Germany is Xing.

Would you like to expand your professional network in the environment of IT professionals? Are you looking for like-minded people or even  for IT professionals as a company? Then you know now what to do!

## Please mind the gap...
### How does the salary differ between genders based on years of coding?
The gender pay gap is a very frequent discussed topic. Women earn much less than their male colleagues even if they are doing the same duties. That leaves us with the question to what extent does the salary of the genders differ from this survey.

More than 90 % of the participants are "male", 7 % were "female" participants and 3 % specified themselves as "other".  In the table you can see, that the gender gap cannot be found in this survey.

### Findings
The table shows that the line is much more straight for male salary. This can be explained by the fact that the number of participants is significantly higher for males. The results show that the gender pay gap is not confirmed. is it because the women who visit such a website and participated in the survey are particularly qualified and tough? Or do we have to redefine the gender pay gap and worry about male salaries!?


## Work wherever you want...
### What impact does the size of a company have on whether IT profesisonals work remotely?
Nowadays companies have to offer their IT professionals much more than just a good salary. The flexibility of working hours and the place of work is becoming increasingly important, especially for generation y. With this in mind, the stack overflow survey can help to answer the question of how much the company size affects how many IT professionals work remotely.

### Findings
64 % of the survey participants do at least some of their work remote. On the table below you can see that the size of the company doesn´t have much impact on the amount that IT professionals work remote. There is just a slightly higher proportion of remote working IT professionals in particularly large or particularly small companies.

## Conclusion
In summary, answering these questions has provided some clues for companies looking for IT professionals. In addition to the preferred job portals of developers worldwide and in Germany, it has also been determined what payment IT professionals are offered depending on their professional experience. Also these results determined to what extent IT professionals carry out their work remotely.
This enables companies, that are looking for qualified IT professionals, to identify some key data about the target group and use that knowledge to achieve their goals.
