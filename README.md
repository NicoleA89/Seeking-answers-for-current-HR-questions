# The war for talents
*A data based approach using the Stack Overflow developer survey data (2017)*


## Introduction
Given the current shortage of skilled workers and demographic change, it is increasingly difficult for companies to find qualified (IT)-professionals. In this article I examined on which job portals worldwide and in Germany qualified developers can be found. The question as to which portals female IT professionals can primarily be found is also being investigated.

Perhaps you have noticed how companies already have to fight for professionals - especially in the field of IT. With that in mind, letÂ´s find out with the data from the Stack Overflow developer survey (2017) on which job portals the participants are present. The survey data was taken by more than 50,000 participants and aims to understand different aspects of job related questions.

## Finding IT professionals
### On which job portals can (German) companies find qualified developers?

Half of the participants answered this question, so the results are based on just under 25,000 participants, who could answer this question with multiple answer options. To get an overview where to find the top candidates, only the top 8 job portals were considered in this article.

## Please mind the gap...
### How does the salary differ between genders based on years of coding?
The gender pay gap is a very frequent discussed topic women earn much less than their male colleagues even if they are doing the same duties. More than 90 % of the participants are "male", 7 % were "female" participants and 3 % specified themselves as "other".  In the table you can see, that the gender gap cannot be found in this survey.

## Findings
The table shows that the line is much more straight for male salary. This can be explained by the fact that the number of participants is significantly higher for males. The results show that the gender pay gap is not confirmed. is it because the women who visit such a website and participated in the survey are particularly qualified and tough? Or do we have to redefine the gender pay gap and worry about male salaries!?
